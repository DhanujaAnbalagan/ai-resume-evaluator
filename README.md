🤖 AI Resume Evaluator Agent
Autonomous AI System for Resume Screening & Evaluation

An end-to-end AI-powered system that evaluates resumes, scores candidates using a structured framework, and delivers recruiter-ready HTML reports via Email and Telegram.

❓ Why This Project Exists

Most resume screening tools operate as black boxes:

No transparency in evaluation

No visible decision logic

No structured scoring

This project was built to expose the logic behind resume evaluation by designing a real autonomous AI agent instead of relying on opaque tools.

🚀 What This System Does

📄 Accepts resumes via Google Docs

🤖 Evaluates resumes using an AI Agent

📊 Scores candidates using a defined competency framework

✉️ Generates professionally formatted HTML reports

📬 Sends results via Gmail

💬 Interacts with users through a Telegram Bot

⚙️ Orchestrated using Make.com + MCP

🧠 Why This Project Matters

This is system-level AI engineering, not prompt engineering.

It demonstrates:

🔍 Transparent evaluation logic

🧱 Structured decision-making

🤖 Autonomous agent execution

🧩 End-to-end workflow automation

✨ Real-world HTML email formatting
