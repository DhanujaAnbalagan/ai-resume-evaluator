🤖 AI Resume Evaluator Agent
An autonomous AI system for resume screening & evaluation

An AI-powered Resume Evaluation System that analyzes resumes, scores candidates across defined competency areas, and delivers professionally formatted HTML evaluation reports via Email and Telegram.

❓ Why I Built This

As an engineering student, I always wondered:

How does my resume actually look when evaluated?

What logic do resume checkers use?

What happens behind the scenes?

So instead of using existing tools, I built one myself.

🚀 Project Overview
🔹 What this system does

📄 Accepts resumes via Google Docs

🤖 Evaluates them using an AI Agent

📊 Scores candidates using a structured framework

✉️ Generates HTML-based professional reports

📬 Sends results via Gmail

💬 Interacts with users through Telegram

⚙️ Uses Make.com automation and MCP

⚠️ This is not a chatbot — it’s a multi-step autonomous AI agent designed to perform a real hiring task.

🧠 Why This Project Matters

Most resume tools are black boxes.

This project emphasizes:

🔍 Transparency in evaluation logic

🧱 Structured decision-making

🤖 Real AI agent behavior (not prompt-only)

🧩 End-to-end system design

✨ Why HTML formatting matters in real workflows
