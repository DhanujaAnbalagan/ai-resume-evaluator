🤖 AI Resume Evaluator Agent

Autonomous AI System for Resume Screening & Evaluation

An end-to-end AI-powered resume evaluation system that analyzes resumes, scores candidates using a structured framework, and delivers professionally formatted HTML evaluation reports via Email and Telegram.

This is not a chatbot.
It is a multi-step autonomous AI agent designed to perform a real-world hiring task.

❓ Why This Project Exists

Most resume screening tools are black boxes:

No clarity on how candidates are judged

No structured decision logic

No transparency in scoring

Instead of trusting opaque tools, this project was built to answer a simple question:

“What actually happens when a resume is evaluated?”

This system exposes the logic, structure, and workflow behind resume screening.
